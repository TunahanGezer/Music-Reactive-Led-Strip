# Music Reactive LED Strip

This project is a **Music Reactive LED Strip**, where an LED strip changes colors and patterns based on audio input. The system uses a microphone or audio line input to analyze the music's frequency and adjust the lighting effects in real-time.

## Components Used

- **LED Strip** (WS2812 or similar)
- **Microcontroller** (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)
- **Microphone/Line Input**
- **Transistors/Amplifiers** (for sound signal processing)
- **Power Supply** (appropriate for the LED strip)

## How It Works

1. The microphone or line input captures the audio signal.
2. The microcontroller processes the signal and breaks it down into frequency bands.
3. The LED strip changes color or pattern based on the frequency and amplitude of the music.

## Project Files

- **Code**: [Link to code file]
- **Circuit Diagram**: [Link to schematic]
- **PCB Design**: [If applicable, link to design files]

## How to Use

1. Assemble the circuit as per the schematic.
2. Upload the provided code to the microcontroller.
3. Connect the audio input and observe the LED strip react to the music.

## Future Improvements

- Add different lighting modes based on beat detection.
- Implement mobile app control for the LED strip.
